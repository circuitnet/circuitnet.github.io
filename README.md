CircuitNet: An Open-Source Dataset for Machine Learning Applications in Electronic Design Automation (EDA)

CircuitNet is an open-source dataset dedicated to machine learning (ML) applications in electronic design automation (EDA). We have collected more than 10K samples from versatile runs of commercial design tools based on open-source RISC-V designs with various features for multiple ML for EDA applications.

This documentation is organized as followed:

- [Introduction](https://circuitnet.github.io/intro/intro.html): introduction and quick start.
- [Feature Description](https://circuitnet.github.io/feature/properties.html): name conventions, calculation method, characteristics and visualization.

This project is under active development. We are expanding the dataset to include diverse and large-scale designs for versatile ML applications in EDA. If you have any feedback or questions, please feel free to contact us.
