# CircuitNet

An Open-Source Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning in VLSI CAD Applications

CircuitNet is an open-source dataset dedicated to machine learning application in VLSI CAD back-end design. We collect more than 10K samples from versatile runs of commercial design tools based on 6 open-source RISC-V designs, and types of features are extracted for release. 

This documentation is organized as followed:

- [Introduction](https://circuitnet.github.io/intro/1.intro.html): introduction and quick start.
- [Feature Description](https://circuitnet.github.io/feature/1.overview.html): name conventions, calculation method, characteristics and visualization.
